# Fetch-A-Doggo
This app fetches you random pictures of dogs! (fetch pictures ... dogs fetch balls, see the irony?)

It fetches an [API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and displays random dog pictures as the user hits the "FETCH!" button on the screen.

My goal here was to practice API calls and their integration within HTML and vanilla javascript.
